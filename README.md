Inheritance on Java using Gradle
--------------------------------

### How to run

- Go to download folder and type in Terminal:  `cd BrujulaIT/inheritance-java-gradle/build` 

- Run `java -jar figures.jar` 

### What's the next (to improve)

- Introduce DockerFile to run from a container.

### What about the code

Source files are inside *BrujulaIT/inheritance-java-gradle/src* folder.

The project have been done using Java 1.8 Version , Gradle for compiling the .jar, for managing dependencies, and Android Studio IDE.

The exercise was easy so I decided to introduce it complexity simulating a basic architecture consisting on a Classes and Repository System.

Factory Static Method, Entity and Repository Patterns have been used. Constant have been declared in static variables way.
